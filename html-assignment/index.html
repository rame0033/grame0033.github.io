            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- Adding a paragraph about me -->
            <p><em>Gian</em> was raised from the Philippines. Graduated <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts"> BA </abbr> Major in Broadcasting at Colegio de San Juan de Letran -Manila. During my 1<sup>st</sup> year of corporate life, I worked as a production assistant on an independent company which consists of only 10 people in a production. Several months later, they discovered that I have a potential on being a video editor, so they let me, but I still assist during video shoots.</p>
            <p>When the pandemic hit, I have to find other opportunities that would improve my abilities in media design since it became in demand. I was able to be hired as a post-production assistant in where I assisted in <strong>doing designs, animating videos, and editing.</strong> In 2023, I enrolled in Algonquin College with the Interactive Media Design program to gain more knowledge and improve more skills.</p>
